title: "FPGA-based Data-glove"
excerpt: "FPGA-based embedded system prototype for calculating in-situ the hand-joint angles from measurements of the accelerometers (sensors) of the data-glove, which I design and develop. Next, angles are sent to a PC via XBee with 100sps and visualized in real-time in a 3D hand-model implemented on Wolfram Mathematica. <br/><img src='/images/data-glove.png'>"
